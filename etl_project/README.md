# Project 2

## Due Wednesday, June 12th, 2022. Code reviews will occur on this day

Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) is a data integration process used to store data in a database so it can be used
by others and create consistent results for analysis. 

## Requirements

It is advised you use the same data source you used for your first project, but you are free to choose another API or data source. 

You will need to work in your team of 2-3 people to complete the following:

1. Create a data model with at least two tables in lucidchart.

2. Create a DDL for each table and execute it programatically. 

3. Load your data using psycopg2 or another module.

4. Make sure your code and the steps you have taken to load your data into the database are clearly outlined. 

## Deliverables

You must submit a link to your group github repository with:

1. A jupyter notebook with all your ETL code in it. I suggest using psycopg2, but you are free to use any other libraries you find.

2. 5-10 SQL queries that highlight how your tables work. You must use at least three joins. Include a comment for each one indicating what it is doing.

3. Be prepared to present on the process you went through. This should not take longer than 8 minutes. Your presentation will be in a code review, 
so please do not create a powerpoint. Instead, you will walk through what code things you learned when working on this project. Do NOT simply go through all your code in an exhaustive manner. 


### Guidelines for your notebook:

- Write up a summary of each step you have gone through using `markdown`. 
- Code should be neat and well documented 
- https://www.dataquest.io/blog/loading-data-into-postgres/ is a great resource to follow
- Use a common repository for your team
