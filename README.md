## Deep Learning Specialization
* For those of you interested in learning more in-depth material about Neural Networks, we highly recommend you to complete the [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). This is a 5 course series from Coursera which deals with implementing a set of state-of-the-art Neural Networks. This is well beyond the scope of CoderGirl- Data Science, but we wanted to keep this here as a reference.
