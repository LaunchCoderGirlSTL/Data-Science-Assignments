# Week 10 - Math for Data Science: Statistics I
        
## In Class Assignment DUE DATE CHANGED - Wednesday, Oct 28, 2020 @5:30pm
* Notebooks
    - Complete the 4 notebooks found in the "week 10/intro2stats/notebooks" folder
        - 01_Warm-up
        - 02_Basic Metrics
        - 03_Distributions
        - 04_Directory with datasets
	
## Homework due Wednesday, October 28, 2020 @5:30pm
* __Keep working on the in-class notebooks,__ they are not due until Wednesday the 28th with the rest of your homework.

* __Complete the Linear Algebra Review__ module of Standford University's Machine Learning Coursera by Andrew Ng
    * Sign up for Coursera, if you don't have an account
    * Go to landing page of course and click Enroll, then select the No Certificate/Free option
        * https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
    * The Linear Algebra Review is the last module in Week 1. It might look locked from the initial page, but it's not. Go to the Week 1 page below and scroll down to get to the Linear Algebra Review section. 
        * https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/1
        * Use this [direct link to first video](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/week/1) if you have issues
    * Watch the videos and take the quizzes in the videos
    * The readings have some errors in my browser where the new line between consecutive rows in vectors and matrices has been converted to a space (e.g. a 2x3 matrix is rendered incorrectly as [a b cd e f]). This is hard to look at, so build intuition and notes through the videos, and then use the programming applets to confirm your intuition. 

* __Review the concept of a derivative__ from Calculus
    * Watch [The paradox of the derivative | Essence of calculus, chapter 2](https://youtu.be/9vKqVkMQHKk) from 3Blue1Brown
    * If you hated that, try [this shorter video](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-calculus-ab/ab-differentiation-1-new/ab-2-1/v/derivative-as-a-concept) from Khan Academy



# Week 9 - Career Week

## In Class Assignment due Friday, Oct 15, 2020 @ 8pm
- None. Keep working on your mini projects if you didn't have the chance to finish!

## Homework due Wednesday, Oct 21, 2020 @ 5:30pm

- Complete [DataCamp Course: Introduction to Statistics in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-statistics-in-python)
    - Advertised as 4 hours. It is usually less in my experience.
    - Honor system in Canvas as usual. 
    - Bring your questions to class! 

### For Fun (Optional)

- Take [DataCamp Assessment: Statistic Fundamentals with Python](https://assessment.datacamp.com/statistics-fundamentals-with-python)
    - 15 question timed assessment that is in no way indicative of real-life DS work, but it might be fun to test your knowledge / frantic googling skills to try to find the meaning of function parameters. Might cover libraries we haven't covered yet, so don't be discouraged. 
    - For those new to statistics with Python, I suggest completing the above course first. Otherwise, feel free to dive in to get ideas on future statistics courses in DataCamp.  

### For Those Who Need Re-Introduction to Probability (Optional)
- See if you have trouble with [this quiz](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library/modal/e/probability_1).
    - If so, then  watch  the videos for [Khan Academy: basic probability section](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library#basic-theoretical-probability). 
    - Continue with videos/articles/quizzes from Khan Academy's [experimental probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library#experimental-probability-lib) and [randomness, probability, and simulation](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability/probability-library#randomness-probability-and-simulation)

- For a longer introduction instead (~5 hours), try [DataCamp: Foundations of Probability in Python](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/foundations-of-probability-in-python). Prioritize your time to complete the statistics foundation course, however. 

### Optional Reading
- The [Khan Academy: Statistics & Probability](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability) course is a great resource to get another video on any concepts that are challenging. Seek out what you need more help on, and your TAs are here to help.
