You need to create a report that summarizes various facts in dataframes.

Your final report should include each of the following:

### Player Count

* Number of Unique Items
* Average Purchase Price
* Total Number of Purchases
* Total Revenue

### Gender Demographics

* Percentage and Count of Male Players
* Percentage and Count of Female Players
* Percentage and Count of Other / Non-Disclosed

### Purchasing Analysis (Gender)

* The below each broken by gender
  * Purchase Count
  * Average Purchase Price
  * Total Purchase Value
  * Average Purchase Total per Person by Gender

  * Purchase Count
  * Average Purchase Price
  * Total Purchase Value
  * Average Purchase Total per Person by Age Group

### Top Spenders

* You must submit a link to your Jupyter Notebook with the viewable Data Frames.
* You must include a written description of three observable trends based on the data.
* See [Example Output](Output_examples.ipynb) for a reference on expected format.
