# Project 1

## Due Wednesday, April 28th, 2021. Presentations will occur on this day

Exploratory data analysis is a data analysis approach that involves building an intuitive understanding
of the dataset at hand. That is what you're being asked to do in this project!

## Requirements

Please pick an API you will use for your analysis. Please chose from the following (I know these work and are good):

1. IEX stock/financial API- https://iexcloud.io/docs/api/ 
2. Quandl stock/financial API - https://www.quandl.com/tools/api
3. NASA - https://api.nasa.gov/
4. Skyscanner Flight API - https://www.partners.skyscanner.net/affiliates/travel-apis
5. AudioDB Music API - https://www.theaudiodb.com/api_guide.php
6. FBI Crime Data API - https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/api
7. You are welcome to pick another API not listed here. Please reach out to your instructor to
have that API approved



You will need to work in your team of 2-3 people to complete the following:

1. Come up with at least one hypothesis or question about your data and no more than three. 
Example: What is the relationship between airline stocks and covid cases?

2. Store your data to check your hypothesis/answer your question in one or more Pandas dataframes. 
Be concise and document your code clearly.

3. Create 2-3 visuals and use basic statistics to explore your data. There is not only one right answer
for how to explore your data.

4. Create a presentation that is 5-8 minutes, which explains your findings. You will be giving this presentation
on the due date.
